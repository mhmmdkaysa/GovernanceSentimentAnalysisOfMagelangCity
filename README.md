# 📊 Government Sentiment Analysis - Magelang City


Welcome to the Magelang City Governance Sentiment Analysis repository!
This project contains the complete data analysis process behind my article, "Optimalisasi Tata Kelola Pemerintahan Melalui Analisis Data Ulasan Google Maps". This research explores how public feedback from Google Maps, collected with the help of the Apify platform, can be transformed into actionable insights for better governance. The full article is proudly published on the official Pilar Statistik website by the Magelang City Office of Communication, Information, and Statistics (Diskominsta). You can read it here:

This repository is meant to:
1. Document the end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) workflow, from data preprocessing to building and evaluating a sentiment analysis model using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
2. Provide a real-world portfolio project demonstrating advanced text data analysis for public policy insights.
3. Share the Python code and methodology used, featuring libraries like Sastrawi, scikit-learn, and Transformers.

"The most honest feedback is the unsolicited kind. We just need to learn how to listen." 🔍🐍
